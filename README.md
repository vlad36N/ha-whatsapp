## 💡 How to use

### The WhatsApp Sensor

The integration provides a binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.whatsapp`).

- **State**: Indicates if the integration is successfully connected to the App.
- **Attributes**:
  - `messages_sent`: Total number of messages sent since restart.
  - `last_message_content`: Content of the last sent message.
  - `last_message_target`: Phone number of the last recipient.

If the sensor is `disabled`, check your Home Assistant "Entities" settings and enable it. It tracks the connection health to the WhatsApp Home Assistant App.

### Services

#### 1. Native WhatsApp Services (Recommended)

Use these for the most robust experience in YAML.

```yaml
service: whatsapp.send_message
data:
  target: '+491234567890'
  message: 'Hello from HA!'
```

#### 2. Legacy Notify (`notify.whatsapp`)

Great for sending to multiple numbers at once or for simple alerts.

```yaml
service: notify.whatsapp
data:
  message: 'Washing machine is done! 🧺'
  target:
    - '+491234567890'
    - '123456789@g.us'
```

#### 3. Modern Notify Action (`notify.send_message`)

> [!WARNING]
> Only use this in the **Visual Editor (UI)**. In YAML, it often fails with `extra keys not allowed`.

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
target:
  entity_id: notify.whatsapp
data:
  message: 'Hello World!'
```

#### 4. Interactive Polls 📊

Gather feedback or make decisions with family/groups.

```yaml
service: whatsapp.send_poll
data:
  target: '+491234567890'
  question: 'What should we have for dinner? 🍕'
  options:
    - 'Pizza'
    - 'Sushi'
    - 'Cooking myself'
```

#### 5. Disappearing Messages ⏳

Ensure privacy by setting an expiration time (matching chat settings).

```yaml
service: whatsapp.send_message
data:
  target: '+491234567890'
  message: 'This message will disappear according to chat rules.'
  expiration: 86400 # 24 hours
```

### 🤖 Automating Replies

You can use Home Assistant automations to react to **incoming messages**, **button clicks**, and **poll votes**.

#### 1. React to a Button Click

When a user clicks a button, a `whatsapp_message_received` event is fired with `type: button_reply` (depending on App version).
The most important field is `buttonId` or `selectedId`.

```yaml
alias: Handle Alarm Button
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: whatsapp_message_received
    event_data:
      type: 'button_reply' # Check your event listener for exact type
      buttonId: 'arm_away' # Matches the ID you sent
action:
  - service: alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away
    target:
      entity_id: alarm_control_panel.home_alarm
  - service: whatsapp.send_message
    data:
      target: '{{ trigger.event.data.from }}'
      message: 'Alarm Armed! 🛡️'
```

#### 2. React to a Poll Vote

Polls fire updates when votes change.

```yaml
alias: Pizza Poll Handler
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: whatsapp_message_received
    event_data:
      type: 'poll_update'
condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ 'Pizza' in trigger.event.data.vote }}"
action:
  - service: whatsapp.send_message
    data:
      target: '{{ trigger.event.data.from }}'
      message: 'Great choice! 🍕'
```

#### 3. General Message Handler

```yaml
alias: WhatsApp Auto-Reply
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: whatsapp_message_received
    event_data:
      content: 'Status'
condition: []
action:
  - service: whatsapp.send_message
    data:
      target: '{{ trigger.event.data.from }}'
      message: "System is Online! 🟢\nBattery: {{ states('sensor.phone_battery_level') }}%"
```

## 🗝️ Native Control & Notifications

This integration works in tandem with the [WhatsApp App](https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/tree/master/whatsapp), which provides several built-in features that don't require any YAML configuration:

### 🎮 Control Commands

If you are configured as an **Admin**, you can control the addon directly via WhatsApp by sending:

- `ha-app-status`: Full health check (Versions, Uptime, Memory).
- `ha-app-help`: List all available control commands.
- `ha-app-logs`: View the latest connection events.
- `ha-app-diagnose`: Run a full diagnostic of all message types.
- `ha-app-restart`: Trigger a reconnect of the WhatsApp session.

### 🔔 System Status Notifications

The app can automatically notify administrators about critical events:

- **✅ Update Success**: Reports when HA Core, the Addon, or this Integration has been successfully updated.
- **🔄 HA Restart**: Notifies you when HA Core is back online after a restart/reboot.
- **🌐 Connectivity**: Alerts if the connection to WhatsApp or HA Core is lost/restored, including downtime duration.

### 👋 Welcome Message

The bot automatically sends a role-aware greeting to new users on their first direct contact, ensuring they know how to interact with the system.

---

## 🆔 Finding Chat IDs & Group IDs

To send messages, you need a `target` ID. The integration makes finding these very easy.

### 1. Private Chats (Phone Numbers)

Use the phone number in international format. The integration automatically adds the required suffix.

- **Example**: `+491234567890` or `491234567890`

### 2. Group IDs (The Easy Way) 🏆

Group IDs look like `120363012345678901@g.us`. Instead of searching through logs or listening to events, use the built-in **Search Service**:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** → **Services**.
2. Select `whatsapp.search_groups`.
3. (Optional) Enter a `name_filter`.
4. Click **Call Service**.
5. **Check your Notifications (Bell icon 🔔 in the sidebar)!** A table with all your groups and their IDs will appear instantly.

### 3. Listening to Events (Advanced)

If you need the ID of a specific incoming message or a dynamic sender:

1. Go to **Developer Tools** → **Events**.
2. Listen to `whatsapp_message_received`.
3. Send a message to the bot. The ID is in the `from` field.

## 🛠️ Requirements & App

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This integration DOES NOT work alone.**
> It is strictly a bridge to the **[HA WhatsApp Home Assistant App](https://github.com/FaserF/hassio-addons/tree/master/whatsapp)**.

### Why?

WhatsApp Web protocols are complex and require a headless browser to maintain encryption and session state.

- **The App**: Runs the browser (Puppeteer/Playwright), handles QR scanning, and encryption.
- **The Integration**: Connects to the App API to expose services and sensors to Home Assistant.

You **Must** install the App from the repo above for this to work.
